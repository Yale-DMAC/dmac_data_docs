# ArchivesSpace User Account Creation

__Please read these instructions thoroughly before creating a user account in ArchivesSpace.__

1. Go to the Yale ArchivesSpace [main page](https://archivesspace.library.yale.edu/) and click on __Sign In__ in the upper right hand corner of the page.
2. Yale NetID:
	- Log in with CAS
	- You will be taken to an account information page to update your account details. An account will be created for your automatically.
3. Non-Yale User:
	- At the bottom of the __Sign In__ dialog box, click on __Need an Account? Register Now__.
4. On the account information page, you will be presented with a form to enter the necessary information to create your user account. Please fill in __only__ the following fields.
	- **Username**: You are __required__ to enter your valid Yale Net ID as your ArchivesSpace username. __If you do not enter your Net ID as your username, your account will be deleted and you will be asked to repeat the registration process. (This will be used for API access or non-CAS login)__.
	- **Full Name**: Please enter your first and last names.
	- **Password**: (This will be used for API access or non-CAS login). Please create a password of your choice to use with ArchivesSpace. It should be something that makes sense to you, and that others can’t readily guess like (e.g. Not 12345). Please do not use the following characters in your password: __@ #  %  &  +  ;__.
	- **Email**: Please enter a valid email address.
	- Click on __Submit__.
5. Please inform your supervisor that you have registered for an ArchivesSpace account.
6. Your supervisor must then send an email on your behalf to your department’s repository manager (see list of ASpace repository managers below) with the subject line “New ArchivesSpace Account Created.” __Your supervisor should cc both you and the [YAMS Co-Chairs](https://guides.library.yale.edu/archivesspace/home) on the email__. The email must contain the following information:
	- Your Yale NetID
	- Yale email address
	- Your first name and last name
	- Your position Title
	- Your department
7. The repository manager will then review the information that you have entered in your user account to make sure it is correct. If it is, they will assign the appropriate user permissions to your account and send you an email to confirm this. __Reminder: if your username does not match your Net ID, your account will be deleted and you will be asked to repeat the registration process__.
8. After your repository manager confirms that you have been assigned user permissions in ArchivesSpace, log in with CAS (or your ArchivesSpace username and password) to make sure you can now access your department’s repository. You can now use ArchivesSpace!
