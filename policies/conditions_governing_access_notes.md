# Conditions Governing Access Notes for Born-Digital Material

This document proposes a procedure for creating file-level access notes for born-digital materials.

## Background

Facilitating access to born-digital materials described in ArchivesSpace is one of the highest priorities for YAMS and YUL in 2020-2021. YAMS has contracted with HM to develop several features which will permit users to request born-digital materials for reading room use via Archives at Yale and Aeon. As part of the development process, members of the ASC advisory group indicated that public services staff who are processing these requests will need a way to identify the materials as being born-digital, as requests for born-digital materials require special processes to fulfill. 

Currently, most units add a RestrictedFragile local access restriction type to file- or series-level born-digital records in ArchivesSpace. However, this restriction type is also applied to materials that are not born-digital, and so cannot be used by staff users of Aeon to identify born digital materials.

In 2021 YAMS approved a request for the addition of a new local access restriction type, BornDigital, which will be added to born digital records at the most appropriate level of description, adhering to DACS descriptive requirements. This new restriction type will be consumed by Aeon and displayed in the ItemInfo8 field, indicating to staff that the material is born digital.

## Proposed Process

### Case 1: Born-digital access note does not exist

Some born-digital materials do not currently have access notes. In these cases, a new note should be created at the appropriate level, with the BornDigital local access restriction type and a text note.

If the collection contains an entire series or other grouping of computer files (i.e. Dworkin), where all children are born-digital, then the local access restriction type and access note text can be applied at the series level, and the local access restriction type will be inherited by all of the children. If the entire collection is born-digital, the restriction type and note can be added at the collection level.

Proposed note text, adapted from MSSA: “As a preservation measure, original materials may not be used. Digital access copies will be provided for use.”

“As a preservation measure, original computer files may not be used. Digital access copies must be provided for use.”

### Case 2: Born-digital access note already exists

In some cases access notes have already been added to born-digital materials at the appropriate level. For instance, this record. In these cases the BornDigital local access restriction should be added to these existing notes, replacing the RestrictedFragile restriction type.

This case only applies to the retroactive updates. Going forward, processors will add the standard note text at the appropriate level when describing born-digital material.

## Documentation/Maintenance

Processors will be responsible for creating these access notes during description.

YAMS will periodically run reports to identify born-digital materials which do not have access notes

If approved by BDAWG and AMDECO, this procedure will be added to YUL’s Born Digital Archival Description Guidelines and the YUL ArchivesSpace User Manual. YAMS will announce the new procedure via yulaspace, and each repository liaison will reach out to their units to coordinate the changes.
