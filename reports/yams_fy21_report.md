# YAMS Activities FY 2020-FY 2021

Over the past year YAMS completed several major projects, including an upgrade to ArchivesSpace v2.7.1. We also contracted with a vendor to develop plugins to 1) enhance our [repository landing pages](https://archives.yale.edu/repositories/12) with Google maps and information about hours of operation, 2) more clearly indicate to users whether materials are stored on- or off-site, and 3) improve public user interface search functionality. In FY20, YAMS also successfully proposed the hiring of a 1.0 FTE Technical Lead for Special Collections, a much-needed expansion of YUL’s capacity for internal development and maintenance of ArchivesSpace and other special collections systems. Our full FY20 work plan, with end-of-year results, is [here](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1JXzfJsVUmK3GI_IP3epIJweaTP-ETY88HZ05n2tDjes%2Fedit%23gid%3D0&data=04%7C01%7Cchristy.tomecek%40yale.edu%7Ce65038bd53e147f76fca08d88a6ff853%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C637411560801124163%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=61bZqx5F6%2BfYtIAZo0SbjwlhvsKNS8%2BwhdB4e5V1x5U%3D&reserved=0).

Major projects for this fiscal year include:

1. **Archives at Yale Development:** In coordination with LIT, BDAWG and ASC, contract with a vendor (Hudson Molonglo) to develop new features for the ArchivesSpace public user interface, including:
    * Updating the Aeon request fulfillment plugin to enable users to place photoduplication requests via Archives at Yale and Aeon. 
    * Improving the process for requesting access to born-digital materials via Archives at Yale and Aeon
    * Improving the display of digital/digitized materials in Archives at Yale by including thumbnail images in search results, enabling filtering/faceting of collections based on the presence of digital materials, and adding an embedded IIIF viewer.
    * Updating the ArchivesSpace-Aeon add-on, which facilitates searching ArchivesSpace within the Aeon staff interface.
2. **ArchivesSpace Staff Interface Development:** Contract with a vendor and work internally to develop new features for the ArchivesSpace staff user interface, including:
    * Improving PDF export to facilitate proofreading of finding aids
    * Adding more detailed site navigation information, including enhancing “breadcrumbs” to more clearly indicate a record’s position in the collection hierarchy
    * Improving data entry functionality for more efficient creation and update of descriptive records.
    * Implementing a plugin to automatically generate box and folder labels within the staff interface
3. **Data Management:** Implement data auditing, reporting, and cleanup protocols; complete internal and external development to improve data entry validation and import/export rules for ArchivesSpace data.
4. **Training:** Implement annual training plan, including general use of the Staff User Interface/Archives at Yale, and specialized training in using the API and the agents and subjects modules.
